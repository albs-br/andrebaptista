    <p>The initial goal was to make such a generic algorithm capable to run any game, without any game-specific information pre-programmed.
      Quickly I realized how ambitious it was and downscaled the project to run a single game with many "hints" hardwired in the code.
      The game chose was the classic River Raid for Atari 2600.

      I know there isn't much "intelligence" here, but in the future it would be possible to "learn" the moving 
      patterns of the game objects and predict the enemies positions and make some cool improvements.

      On the technical side, it was done in C# Console Application, and the target game is running in an emulator for web browsers 
      called <a href="http://javatari.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">JavaAtari</a> (cheers to the creator, 
      <a href="https://github.com/ppeccin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Paulo Peccin</a>, it is really a masterpiece).
