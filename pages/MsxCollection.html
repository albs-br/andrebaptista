    <p>My humble MSX collection</p>

    <p>
      With my recent (renewed) interest on the MSX standard I decided to collect some models that I particulary fell interesting 
      on some aspect (okay, mostly because they are fantastic pieces of 80's electronics design and live witnesses of the pinacle 
      of engineering quality).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For years I had the desire of collecting some kind of vintage electronics and the MSX, with my personal past experience, 
      the great national and international communities, and it's incredible variety of makers and models happened to be the perfect 
      match.    
    </p>

    <p>
      So far I bought four models, three of them on Yahoo Japan Auctions (via Jauce middleman service), and one on my country, 
      Brazil, via MSX community on Whatsapp.

      From the first to the last purchased:

      It looks for me a well balanced collection, two MSX1, one MSX2 and one 2+. Three being the keyboard computer-format so common 
      that time, and one with detached keyboard (for semi-professional use). Two Sony, one Pioneer, and one Panasonic.
    </p>    
    
    <p>
      The notable one missing is the Turbo-R, but they are far higher priced and I have not a justifiable use for them, I'm far away 
      from use all the MSX 2 capabilities on my own homebrew games, let's say a beast like the Turbo R. Even the released 
      games/applications are few and most (all?) on Japanese language, both commercial and homebrew developed. So this one will be out 
      of idea for now, unless a very good deal surface (pretty uncommon).

      There are a few other models that I will keep on my radar, but only if on perfect conditions AND reasonably priced. I ain't 
      addicted to this virus called collecting yet (or at least I want to think that). Maybe next year one more package from Japan 
      full of cool things.

      As a fun side note: I managed to successfully bid on a Super Famicom console for just 1 yene (!!!). Not on the best condition 
      for sure, but with box at least.

      Thanks for reading.
