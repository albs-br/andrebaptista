    <p>I've always had the idea of joining my (meager) electronics knowledge with the programming knowledge.
      To know where is the lost link between the instruction in Assembly language and the logic gates that brings life to it.</p>
    <p>The project progress is documented on the <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/24511-jaca-1-2-homebrew-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hackaday site.</a></p>
    <p>I started by doing the logical project on a software called <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Logisim</a>. First I've done a small 4 bit CPU as a POC
      (Proof Of Concept), and then the 8 bit version:</p>

      I also made an Assembler program in C#/Windows Forms. An assembler is a program that converts the Assembly language
      (a mnemonic that is easier for a human to read) in the Machine Code (the zeroes and ones that is effectivelly the 
      only "language" the computer understands). Here is it:

      That was the easy part. So I started building the computer on breadboards, module by module. The first one (the simplest) was very 
      straightfoward, but as I added more and more modules the problems started to arise. It costed me MONTHS of work until I realized 
      that with these very poor quality chinese breadboards I wouldn't go nowhere.

      Then I decided to move on to another approach and rebuilt the computer on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), designing the circuits
      on the <a href="https://easyeda.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EasyEDA</a> online platform and ordering the PCBs with the <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">JLC PCB</a>.

    <p>
      Some time ago, I made a javascript emulator for the CPU, I think it's worth to show here:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://jaca-emulator.stackblitz.io/">Link</a> to the emulator working. Try clicking "Load", then select "Test OUT/SHL/SHR", and click "Play".
