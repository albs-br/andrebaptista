      Around a month ago I got myself fully absorbed by a new and strange hobby: to make homebrew games for the original Gameboy (that brick model from 1989).
      It's very unusual since I never had one back in the day (they were imported and VERY expansive that time on Brazil). I didn't even saw one live.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Well, I don't know exactly how, but I started to eagerly read all documentation about its hardware (like 
      <a href="https://gbdev.io/pandocs/">this</a>, 
      <a href="https://gb-archive.github.io/salvage/tutorial_de_ensamblador/tutorial_de_ensamblador%20%5BLa%20decadence%5D.html">this</a>, 
      and <a href="https://eldred.fr/gb-asm-tutorial/introduction.html">this</a>) and see YT videos on the subject (like 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyzD8pNlpwI">this great presentation</a>, 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZUDEaLa5Nw">this</a> and 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQE1K074v3s">this</a>).
      And the fact is I have much fun by doing retro programming, getting to know more deeply 
      about specifics of the hardware and the history involved with them. Next victims will possibly be 
      <a href="https://mynameismjp.wordpress.com/2019/01/14/adventures-in-retro-development-snes-edition/">SNES</a> and 
      <a href="https://www.smspower.org/maxim/HowToProgram/Index">Master System</a>, or any other 8/16 bits cool platform.

      I quickly setup an enviroment using VS Code, rgbasm, Gameboy Tile Designer, and BGB/Emulicious emulators. This was a matter of a couple hours, great 
      improvement over the 2 days I spent between setting an environment and making the first Hello World works on MSX. Experience with retro development 
      starts to paying off. The help of community, as always, is invaluable, like <a href="https://gbdev.gg8.se/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=4593#p4593">here</a>.

    <p>GB technical specs:
      <ul>
        <li>160x144 pixels screen (20x18 tiles of 8x8)</li>
        <li>4 "colors" (actually 4 shades of gray)</li>
        <li>40 sprites on screen, max 10 per scanline</li>
        <li>sprites can be 8x8 or 8x16, have 3 colors</li>
        <li>sprites also can be inverted both horizontally and vertically</li>
        <li>tiles and sprites share the same char map (there is a trick here)</li>
        <li>background and window layers</li>
        <li>hw scroll for background, (bg are scrollable independently of window, which itself is adequate to score/lives/other fixed stuff)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      The GB has a CPU much close of Z80, most instructions are equal, so the learning curve on this aspect isn't so steep. On the other hand the PPU is 
      much different of the TMS9918 that I am used so far.

      As Proof of Concept I am doing a simple game called Paranoid (github <a href="https://github.com/albs-br/paranoid">here</a>), a sort of 
      Arkanoid/Breakout clone:

      While learning new features I am putting them on the game, such as: using the interruptions for split the window top and bottom, doubling the 
      sprites (that's a cool trick, by doing this you can put 80 or even more sprites on screen at same time). And even simple things like a game loop 
      V-blank synced, which I still don't know on MSX. Sometimes you need to go to another platform to get a different view, and learn a new way/better 
      of make something you thought you knew.
