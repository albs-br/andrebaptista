    <p>While digging old books, magazines and current MSX community resources, I had an idea for a game. As it's on the github description: 
      Shoot'em up vertical scrolling game for MSX 1 made in Assembly, inspired by 8-bit classics such as 1942.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      At same time I stumbled with the MSX Dev, a contest of homebrew games for MSX machines, which since 2003 has revealed more than 150
      new games for the platform. And the submission period were open. So, why not?
    </p>

    <p>As I have no physical machine to test, all the work was done with emulators, such as openMSX, Emulicious and Web MSX. Only on later 
      development stages, some people of the MSX community tested the game on real hardware.
    </p>
  
    <p>My setup on this work:
      <ul>
        <li>VS Code with many cool extensions;</li>
        <li>tniASM 0.45;</li>
        <li>MSX Pen to test some small pieces of code on isolation</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The game can be played online on <a href="https://www.file-hunter.com/MSXdev/index.php?id=pacific">Filehunter</a>, source code on 
      <a href="https://github.com/albs-br/pacific">github</a>, MSX Dev entry <a href="https://www.msxdev.org/2020/07/28/msxdev20-16-pacific/">here</a>,
