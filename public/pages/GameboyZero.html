    <p>The Gameboy Zero is the attempt to put inside a classic Gameboy case a Raspberry Pi Zero
    with all required extras to run a Retropie OS and made it possible to play virtually any game
    from Atari 2600 to PS1 at any place.</p>

      Despite the fact that it looks relativelly simple and straightforward to do I'm facing a lot o problems to make it work. For example, I have 3 LCD screens and 
      each one imposes a difficult and I'm yet to choose between them.
