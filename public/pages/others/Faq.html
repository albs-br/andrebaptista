      How old were you when wrote the first code line?
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      12 years. Basic on MSX. Later, Assembly. As I haven't any storage device 
      for some time (neither k7 tapes nor disks), I used to write down the code 
      on a paper and retype everything each time I want to run! That was fun, 
      besides this downside. Some years after I finnaly got a 5" 1/4 disk drive.

      Why everything in english? Aren't you brazilian?
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      First reason: to improve my english skills.<br />
      Second: to reach a broader audience. English has around 1,5 billion speakers
      (most as second language) against 260 million portuguese speakers.<br />
