    <p>Draft project of a kit to turn an old NES console into a computer</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="w3-container">

    <p>
      One thing that I never understood well (*): why there weren't a way to turn the old videogame consoles into computers (**).
      I mean, computers on the 80's were expansive, very expansive. Why not put a game console and a computer together?
      That would be a great cost optimization.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I started to think: what if the NES had a kit to turn it into an 8-bit computer, such as the computers of the era, like the C64.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then I made a small plan, much on the style Arne Niklas Jansson made 
      <a href="http://androidarts.com/Amiga/MSX.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>, 
      <a href="http://androidarts.com/Amiga/ZX.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and 
      <a href="http://androidarts.com/SEGA/SEGAcube.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.
      Of course I lack the artistic skills, but I decided to write this down, to organize some ideas I had:
    </p>
    <p>
      First things first: why NES? Why not SNES, PS1? Because on the NES era, the computers (even home computers) were more expansive, and
      it makes more economical sense to be done with a NES than with an further console, of an era when the computer prices already dropped a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will adopt the premise of an unlicensed add on to NES, launched a little after the console, so we are talking about the year of 1986.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first idea was to make a cartridge with socket for a keyboard. Cartriges are not only for software, they can be used for hardware expansions too, 
      as any MSX owner knows very well. This option has the obvious downside of the need to keep the NES cart door open. The advantage would be the 
      possibility of using any commercial standard keyboard, but on that time there weren't a keyboard standard as the de facto standard, as 
      today we have USB, and before the PS/2.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I think: the nes controller works on a serial way: it transfers a byte each cycle, and each bit represents the state of a single button 
      (the directional pad is in reality 4 buttons). I can use a combination of these buttons for each key of the keyboard.
      Even better: I can use invalid combinations (it's mechanically impossible to press up and down at same time, for example) as keys.
      I decided to use this approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have 7 invalid directional states:
      <ul>
        <li>all four directions pressed</li>
        <li>3 directions pressed (that is, four kinds of this one)</li>
        <li>up an down</li>
        <li>left and right</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We need at least one key to be possible to use in combination with others, I chose the Shift key.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have the premise that the keyboard should be able to be used as an ordinary controller, and the constroller should be able to be used as a keyboard
      (of course only the direcion keys and some few others):
      <ul>
        <li>Arrow keys will be equivalent to gamepad directions</li>
        <li>The Enter key will be the same as Start button</li>
        <li>Shift is Select button</li>
        <li>A and B buttons I haven't decided yet</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

        <div class="w3-container w3-center">
          <p>Japanese Sony HB-F700 MSX computer, released on 1986. This keyboard would be perfect for the NES computer with few adaptations.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>
      The above keyboard, from a Sony MSX computer would be great fit for this project, with minor changes, such as arrow keys moved to under
      the numeric pad, for better gaming experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      (*) Yes, I know the target audience of game consoles and home computers were distinct, being games more for children and computers more for teenagers and 
      young people, but given the huge market the consoles had, even the small overlap between these two demographics could be an attractive niche.
      I know also that console makers such as Nintendo and Sega had zero interest to do this, that's why I think of an independent hardware maker 
      (Nintendo wouldn't be very happy and some legal battle would happen).
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the software side, it's unclear for me: just an BASIC intepreter like the computers of the era, or an small operating system with utilities
      such as calendar, notepad, calc, a simple spreadsheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some kind of battery backed memory on the cart would be necessary, to save programs and data.
    </p>

    <p>
      Printer port, monitor output, and even a 3" 1/2 disk drive would be possible to be attached on the NES expansion port at the bottom:

      (**) Actually I find this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUsL7qI_GTs&t=1115s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">one</a>, 
      for Atari 2600. Keyboard attached on cartridge, as my first idea. Cool.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also discovered later this official prototype from a Sega Mega Drive/Genesis computer, never launched:

    <p>
      Some fellows of MRC also pointed out many other console-computers 
      <a href="https://www.msx.org/forum/msx-talk/hardware/strange-frankestein-hardware-turn-sms-computer?page=5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>, 
      even a cool Japanese Famicom with BASIC.

      Thanks for reading.
